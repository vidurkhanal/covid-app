              Seek immediate medical attention if you have serious symptoms.
              Always call before visiting your doctor or health facility. People
              with mild symptoms who are otherwise healthy should manage their
              symptoms at home. On average it takes 5â€“6 days from when someone
              is infected with the virus for symptoms to show, however it can
              take up to 14 days.
